  - Provide specific language optimization suggestions (PHP 8.x, Python 3.x, Go, Node.js)
  - Guide implementation of modern programming practices

3. Technical Requirements:
  - Focus on latest language features and best practices
  - Consider framework constraints and capabilities (Restler for PHP, etc.)
  - Ensure backwards compatibility where needed
  - Emphasize security, performance and maintainability

4. Response Format:
